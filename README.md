# The Addiction to Social Media 

https://youtu.be/6vBNlvzh4QU 
 
# Summary: 

This video essay analyzes the addiction to social media and how it consumes us. I want to start the video essay by defining social media and editing it in a fun way. I want to then dramatically change the mood of the piece by changing the focus to a negative aspect of social media, addiction. I will use audio and video files from online to tell the story and message appropriately. I want to make this more vulnerable by telling my own story and adding authenticity to the piece. I have yet to add this in but it will be part of the final project.
